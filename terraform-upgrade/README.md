## CHANGELOG.md 0.14
- https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v0.14/CHANGELOG.md

- Terraform v1.0 is an unusual release in that its primary focus is on stability, and it represents the culmination of several years of work in previous major releases to make sure that the Terraform language and internal architecture will be a suitable foundation for forthcoming additions that will remain `backward-compatible`.
- Terraform v1.0.0 intentionally has no significant changes compared to Terraform v0.15.5. You can consider the v1.0 series as a direct continuation of the v0.15 series.
- There are no special steps to take if you are upgrading from the previous major release, Terraform v0.15.
- You can also upgrade directly from Terraform v0.14 if you wish
- Upgrade directly to the latest Terraform v1.0 release and attempt a normal Terraform run. Terraform v1.0 is a continuation of the v0.15 series, and so v1.0.0 and later are directly backward-compatible with Terraform v0.15.5.

## Upgrading terraform configuration from 0.12.30 to 1.0(latest)
- https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/upgrading-terraform-configuration-from-0-12-30-to-1-0-latest/27997

We are planning to upgrade our terraform configuration from version 0.12.30 to the latest version 1.0. few questions that are in my mind that i want to confirm.

Can we directly upgrade from 0.12.30 to 1.0 or do we need to go to 0.13 first?
What is recommended approach for terraform configuration upgrade?
Please suggest to me the best practice for an upgrade.


 yes, you have to upgrade first to 0.13.X, because there have been some changes in the format of the backend. Then the recommended path is to also upgrade to 0.14.X, and Hashicorp says that it could be possible to upgrade to 1.0.X.

 Terraform support backward compatibility starting from 1.0.X.
